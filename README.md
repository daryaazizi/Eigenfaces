# Eigenfaces

The notebook demonstrates two applications of Eigenfaces: facial recognition and image compression. 

**Explore the Notebook [here](./EigenFaces.ipynb)**.



## Overview

### Facial Recognition

By projecting new faces onto the subspace spanned by the extracted eigenfaces, we can effectively compare them to known faces and establish matches or non-matches.



### Image Compression

Eigenfaces can also be leveraged for image compression. By representing images using a smaller set of eigenfaces and corresponding coefficients, we can significantly reduce the storage requirements while preserving essential facial features.
